# QuickNotes
QuickNotes is an app where people can take time to write down notes that will save and be available to them 24/7 on the get go. If you want to edit a note this can be done by clicking on it and there is also a delete button at the bottom if the user wants to remove the note. If the app is closed or restarted the progress is saved into CoreData which allows the app to pick up and continue from where it began. There is also a chatbot that was made using a package from OpenAISwift on github that can be asked any questions on the go and will reply with an answer. A secret key was acquired from the OpenAI website to make this chatbot run. Another github package that was used includes the IQKeyboardManagerSwift which moves the keyboard so it doesn't get in the way of the writing when a user is a typing a note. QuickNotes is designed for iPhone, iPad and Mac (Designed for iPad) and also requires iOS 16.2 or later to run. It is Xcode 14.0 compatible.
